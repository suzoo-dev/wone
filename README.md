# :tada: Graham Fletcher's WONE Assessment :tada:

## Getting Started

The project is split into two parts: the backend and the frontend.
Please refer to the respective READMEs for instructions on how to run each part.

- [The Backend](./backend/README.md)
- [The Frontend](./frontend/README.md)

## Notes

- Editing an assessment should put a temporary lock on the assessment record preventing other users from editing it.
- Responses should be linked to a version of the assessment.
